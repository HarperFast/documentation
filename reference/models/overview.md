<VersionBadge version="v5.1.0" />

Harper provides a unified API for calling AI models — text embeddings, text generation, and typed decisions — from application code. Models are configured by an operator under logical names; application code requests a model by its logical name and Harper routes the call to the configured backend (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Amazon Bedrock) — or to a [custom backend](./backends#custom-backends) a component registers. Swapping providers is a configuration change, not a code change — [Local Development](./local-development) uses this to run the same application against local models in development and hosted providers in production. A logical name can also name an ordered group of backends to try, and calls can require specific capabilities — see [Routing & Fallback](./routing).

The API is exposed as a single process-wide `models` object:

```javascript
import { models } from 'harper';

const [vector] = await models.embed('What is Harper?');
const reply = await models.generate('Describe the Harper resource API in one sentence.');
const route = await models.decide(ticket.body, { enum: ['billing', 'refund', 'bug', 'other'] });
```

The same object is available as `scope.models` in component scopes and as the `models` global. All three refer to the same instance.

The API surface is six methods:

| Method                                                           | Purpose                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`models.embed(input, options?)`](./api#embed)                   | Convert text to embedding vectors                                                   |
| [`models.generate(input, options?)`](./api#generate)             | Generate a completion for a prompt or chat                                          |
| [`models.generateStream(input, options?)`](./api#generatestream) | Stream a completion as it is produced                                               |
| [`models.decide(state, schema, options?)`](./api#decide)         | Choose from a closed set, with a probability distribution over it                   |
| [`models.getDecision(id)`](./api#getdecision)                    | Read a decision recorded with `persist: true`, and what was recorded about it since |
| [`models.recordOutcome(id, outcome)`](./api#recordoutcome)       | Record what actually happened for a decision recorded with `persist: true`          |

Generation supports [tool calling](./tool-calling), including a built-in agent loop (`toolMode: 'auto'`) that resolves tool calls in-process. Decisions are served by [decision backends](./backends#decision-backends), including a built-in adapter that scores the allowed values from any configured generative model's log-probabilities where the model exposes them, and votes over structured completions otherwise. Tables can compute embedding vectors automatically at write time with the [`@embed` schema directive](../database/schema#embed), and vectors can be searched with [HNSW vector indexes](../database/schema#vector-indexing); the [`@decide` schema directive](../database/schema#decide) likewise stores a typed decision and its probability whenever a source field is written. New to decisions? Begin with [Start here: typed decisions](#start-here-typed-decisions). Every model call is recorded for [observability and usage accounting](./analytics).

## Start here: typed decisions

<VersionBadge version="v5.3.0" />

`decide()` answers a question with one value from a list you give it, plus how likely each value is. Use it for routing, moderation, triage, and yes/no checks. Most applications need only the four steps below. The [API reference](./api#decide) covers everything else.

**1. Configure one decision model.** A decision model sits on top of a generative model. This is the smallest working configuration:

```yaml
models:
  generative:
    default:
      backend: openai
      apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      model: gpt-4o
  decision:
    default:
      backend: generative
      generative: default
```

With OpenAI, each field with up to 20 allowed values costs one scoring call. A field with more values, or a model that cannot score, is asked `samples` times (default 5) and the answers are counted, which multiplies the token cost. [Generative decision adapter](./backends#generative-decision-adapter) has the details.

**2. Make a decision.** Call `decide()` from code:

```javascript
import { models } from 'harper';

const decision = await models.decide(ticket.body, {
	enum: ['billing', 'refund', 'bug', 'other'],
	description: 'Which queue should handle this support ticket?',
});
// decision.value is the chosen queue, and decision.probability is how likely it is
```

Or have a table decide whenever a record is written, with the [`@decide` directive](../database/schema#decide):

```graphql
type Ticket @table {
	id: Long @primaryKey
	body: String
	route: String @decide(source: "body", values: ["billing", "refund", "bug", "other"], confidence: "routeConfidence")
	routeConfidence: Float @indexed
}
```

The directive calls the model on every write that carries `body`, so it costs one decision per such write.

**3. Act on the probability, and send the rest to a person.** Pick a threshold, automate above it, and route everything below it to review:

```javascript
if (decision.probability >= 0.8) await route(ticket, decision.value);
else await sendToReview(ticket, decision);
```

`decision.calibrated` is `false` for the built-in adapter. Its probability ranks the choices well, but it is not a measured frequency: 0.8 does not mean the decision is right 80% of the time. Start with a cautious threshold and adjust it once you know how often decisions above it turn out right, which is what step 4 is for.

**4. Record outcomes only when you will use them.** By default nothing is stored beyond the per-call log, and the result has no `id`. When you want to check decisions against what really happened, pass `persist: true` and report the truth later:

```javascript
const decision = await models.decide(ticket.body, queues, { persist: true });
// Later, when a person confirms the right queue:
await models.recordOutcome(decision.id, { truth: { kind: 'value', value: 'refund' } });
```

For a table, add a `decision` field to the directive; it receives the id. [Recording decisions](./api#recording-decisions) compares the two modes, and [Analytics](./analytics#durable-decisions) shows how to query what was recorded. Record the truth for a random sample of decisions as well as the ones people happened to review, so the record reflects all of your traffic.

## Configuration

<VersionBadge type="changed" version="v5.3.0" />

Models are configured in the `models` section of `harper-config.yaml`, split by capability into `embedding`, `generative`, and `decision` maps. Each key is a logical model name; each entry names a `backend` plus backend-specific settings:

```yaml
models:
  embedding:
    default:
      backend: ollama
      host: localhost:11434
      model: nomic-embed-text:latest
  generative:
    default:
      backend: openai
      apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      model: gpt-4o
    fast:
      backend: ollama
      model: mistral:7b
  decision:
    default:
      backend: generative
      generative: default
      samples: 5
```

The logical name `default` is used when application code does not pass an explicit `model` option. Calling a logical name that is not configured throws an error.

See [Backends](./backends) for the full set of configuration fields supported by each backend.

### Credentials

String values in model entries support environment-variable indirection with `${VAR_NAME}` syntax, resolved at startup. Use this for API keys rather than placing the literal key in the configuration file — Harper logs a warning at startup when a credential field contains a literal value. If the referenced environment variable is unset, the placeholder is left as-is; for credential fields the backend rejects the unresolved placeholder at startup, while other fields (such as `host` or `model`) carry the literal placeholder into requests — surfacing as per-request failures rather than a startup error. Indirection applies to string-typed fields only; numeric fields such as `requestTimeoutMs` must be literal values.

### Startup behavior

Model entries are registered when Harper boots, before components load, so `models` is usable from component initialization onward.

Model entries are validated with the rest of the configuration file at startup: a structurally invalid entry — a missing required field such as `apiKey`, an unrecognized field name, or a wrong value type — fails configuration validation and prevents Harper from starting, like any other configuration error. Errors at registration time (for example, an unrecognized `backend` name) are logged and skipped without blocking startup or other model entries.
