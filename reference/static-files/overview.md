# Static Files

- Added in: v4.5.0
- Changed in: v4.7.0 - (Migrated to Plugin API and new options added)
- Changed in: v5.2.0 - (`before` / `after` handler ordering options)

The `static` built-in plugin serves static files from your Harper application over HTTP. Use it to host websites, SPAs, downloadable assets, or any static content alongside your Harper data and API endpoints.

`static` does **not** need to be installed — it is built into Harper and only needs to be declared in your `config.yaml`.

## Basic Usage

Configure `static` with the `files` option pointing to the files you want to serve:

```yaml
static:
  files: 'site/**'
```

Given a component with this structure:

```
my-app/
├─ site/
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ about.html
│  ├─ blog/
│     ├─ post-1.html
│     ├─ post-2.html
├─ config.yaml
```

Files are accessed relative to the matched directory root, so `GET /index.html` returns `site/index.html` and `GET /blog/post-1.html` returns `site/blog/post-1.html`.

## `files` and `urlPath` Options

<VersionBadge version="v4.5" />

`static` is a [Plugin](../components/overview.md) and supports the standard `files` and `urlPath` configuration options for controlling which files to serve and at what URL path.

Use `urlPath` to mount the files at a specific URL prefix:

```yaml
static:
  files: 'site/**'
  urlPath: 'app'
```

Now `GET /app/index.html` returns `site/index.html` and `GET /app/blog/post-1.html` returns `site/blog/post-1.html`.

See [Components Overview](../components/overview.md) for full `files` glob pattern and `urlPath` documentation.

## Additional Options

<VersionBadge version="v4.7" />

In addition to the standard `files`, `urlPath`, and `timeout` options, `static` supports these configuration options:

- **`index`** - `boolean` - _optional_ - If `true`, automatically serves `index.html` when a request targets a directory. Defaults to `false`.

- **`extensions`** - `string[]` - _optional_ - File extensions to try when an exact path match is not found. For example, `extensions: ['html']` means a request for `/page-1` will also try `/page-1.html`.

- **`fallthrough`** - `boolean` - _optional_ - If `true`, passes the request to the next handler when the requested file is not found. Set to `false` when using `notFound` to customize 404 responses. Defaults to `true`.

- **`notFound`** - `string | { file: string; statusCode: number }` - _optional_ - A custom file (or file + status code) to return when a path is not found. Useful for serving a custom 404 page or for SPAs that use client-side routing. See [Handler Ordering](#handler-ordering) — combine with `after: 'rest'` if your application also serves an API.

- **`before`** - `string | false` - _optional_ - <VersionBadge version="v5.2.0" /> Run this handler before the named handler in the HTTP middleware chain. Defaults to `'authentication'` so plain file requests skip credential parsing. Set to `false` to clear the default without adding a new constraint (registration order applies).

- **`after`** - `string` - _optional_ - <VersionBadge version="v5.2.0" /> Run this handler after the named handler, e.g. `after: 'rest'` to let REST resources match before static fallbacks. Setting `after` overrides the default `before: 'authentication'`.

## Handler Ordering

<VersionBadge version="v5.2.0" />

By default, `static` handles GET requests **before** authentication — and therefore before the [REST](../rest/overview.md) handler, which runs after authentication. This keeps plain file requests fast, and with the default `fallthrough: true` it is invisible: requests that do not match a file simply pass to the next handler.

It matters as soon as you set `fallthrough: false`: the static handler then responds to every unmatched GET itself — including GETs for your exported REST resources, which never get a chance to run. Harper logs a startup warning when it detects this combination.

If your application serves both static files and an API, order the static handler after REST:

```yaml
rest: true

static:
  files: 'dist/**'
  # Let the REST handler match first; only unmatched URLs get the fallback.
  after: 'rest'
  notFound:
    file: 'dist/index.html'
    statusCode: 200
  fallthrough: false
```

```
GET /Dog/1          -> 200 application/json   (REST resource)
GET /assets/app.js  -> 200 text/javascript    (static file)
GET /app/settings   -> 200 text/html          (index.html - client-side route)
```

Ordering is applied when the component loads; changing `before` or `after` in `config.yaml` automatically restarts the component so the new ordering takes effect.

## Auto-Updates

<VersionBadge version="v4.7.0" />

Because `static` uses the Plugin API, it automatically responds to changes without requiring a Harper restart. Adding, removing, or modifying files — or updating `config.yaml` — takes effect immediately. The one exception is [handler ordering](#handler-ordering): changing `before` or `after` automatically restarts the component to rebuild the middleware chain, rather than taking effect in place.

## Examples

### Basic static file serving

Serve all files in the `static/` directory. Requests must match file names exactly.

```yaml
static:
  files: 'static/**'
```

### Automatic `index.html` serving

Serve `index.html` automatically when a request targets a directory:

```yaml
static:
  files: 'static/**'
  index: true
```

With this structure:

```
my-app/
├─ static/
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ blog/
│     ├─ index.html
│     ├─ post-1.html
```

Request mappings:

```
GET /            -> static/index.html
GET /blog        -> static/blog/index.html
GET /blog/post-1.html -> static/blog/post-1.html
```

### Automatic extension matching

Combine `index` and `extensions` for clean URLs without file extensions:

```yaml
static:
  files: 'static/**'
  index: true
  extensions: ['html']
```

Request mappings with the same structure:

```
GET /            -> static/index.html
GET /blog        -> static/blog/index.html
GET /blog/post-1 -> static/blog/post-1.html
```

### Custom 404 page

Return a specific file when a requested path is not found:

```yaml
static:
  files: 'static/**'
  notFound: 'static/404.html'
  fallthrough: false
```

A request to `/non-existent` returns the contents of `static/404.html` with a `404` status code.

> **Note:** When using `notFound`, set `fallthrough: false` so the request does not pass through to another handler before the custom 404 response is returned. If the application also serves an API, add `after: 'rest'` — see [Handler Ordering](#handler-ordering).

### SPA client-side routing

For SPAs that handle routing in the browser with the History API, return the main application file for any path that does not match an API route or a static file:

```yaml
rest: true

static:
  files: 'static/**'
  after: 'rest'
  fallthrough: false
  notFound:
    file: 'static/index.html'
    statusCode: 200
```

A request to any unmatched path returns `static/index.html` with a `200` status code, allowing the client-side router to handle navigation. The `after: 'rest'` ordering (added in v5.2.0) allows REST resources to be matched first; without it, the fallback would intercept API GETs too — see [Handler Ordering](#handler-ordering).

Alternatively, SPAs that use hash-based routing (e.g. React Router's `createHashRouter` or Vue Router's `createWebHashHistory`) need no fallback at all: every page loads from `/`, which also keeps `index.html` cacheable at a single URL. This works on every Harper version.

## Dynamic Applications

The `static` plugin handles pure static file hosting. If you need server-side rendering, API routes, or other dynamic behavior, consider using a plugin designed for that purpose:

- [`@harperfast/nextjs`](../components/nextjs.md) - Run a full Next.js application (SSR, ISR, API routes) directly on Harper
