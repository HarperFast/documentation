# Scheduler

<VersionBadge version="v5.2.0" />

The scheduler is a built-in plugin that runs recurring jobs declared in a component's configuration. Harper invokes a designated export from your component on a cron or interval schedule. In a cluster, execution is leader-coordinated: under normal operation each occurrence runs once, on a single automatically elected node, rather than once per node or worker. This coordination relies on the `hdb_scheduler_state` system table replicating to every participating node (see [Cluster Behavior](#cluster-behavior)). During leadership failover, daylight-saving fall-back, or split-brain recovery an occurrence can occasionally be delivered more than once - which is why handlers must be idempotent (see below).

Use it for the recurring work applications otherwise hand-roll with `setInterval`: taking daily snapshots of a dataset, pulling from an external API on a schedule, re-aggregating summary tables, generating digests or reports.

For expiring old records, prefer the table-level [`expiration` and `eviction` options](../database/schema.md#table) - record cleanup is built into Harper and does not need a scheduled job.

## Configuration

In your component's `config.yaml`, use the `scheduler` key to declare jobs. If your application does not yet have a `config.yaml`, note that creating one **replaces** Harper's [default component configuration](./overview.md#default-configuration) rather than merging with it - keep the plugins your app relies on (`rest`, `graphqlSchema`, `jsResource`, and so on) declared alongside the `scheduler` block, or your endpoints and resources will stop loading:

```yaml
scheduler:
  jobs:
    - name: daily-metrics-snapshot
      cron: '0 2 * * *'
      timezone: America/New_York
      handler: ./jobs.js#snapshotMetrics
    - name: sync-exchange-rates
      interval: 15m
      handler: ./jobs.js#syncExchangeRates
```

Each job entry supports:

### `name`

Type: `string` (required)

A name for the job, unique within the component. Used in logs and to key the job's run state.

### `cron`

Type: `string`

A five-field cron expression: minute, hour, day-of-month, month, day-of-week. Supports `*`, lists (`1,15`), ranges (`9-17`), steps (`*/15`, `0-59/5`), month and day names (`JAN`, `MON-FRI`), and the common macros (`@hourly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@yearly`). Day-of-week `0` and `7` both mean Sunday. Following the POSIX cron rule, when both day-of-month and day-of-week are restricted, the job runs when either matches.

There is no seconds field. Expressions that can never fire (such as `0 0 30 2 *` - February 30th) are rejected when the component loads.

Always quote the expression in YAML: a leading `*` (as in `*/5 * * * *`) is YAML alias syntax and `@daily` starts with a reserved character - unquoted, both fail with confusing YAML parse errors rather than anything about cron.

Exactly one of `cron` or `interval` is required.

### `interval`

Type: `string` (duration) or `number` (seconds)

A simple cadence instead of a cron expression: a number of seconds, or a duration string like `90s`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`. Must be between one second and 365 days. Use this for "every N" maintenance passes that do not align to wall-clock times.

### `timezone`

Type: `string`

An IANA timezone (for example `America/Chicago`) the cron expression is evaluated in. Defaults to the server's timezone - specifically, the local timezone of whichever node is currently the scheduler leader. In a cluster whose nodes may not share a host timezone, set an explicit `timezone`: otherwise a failover between differently-configured nodes can shift a job like `0 2 * * *` by hours, producing an extra or missing wall-clock run. Only valid with `cron`.

During daylight-saving transitions: a job scheduled inside the spring-forward gap (a wall-clock time that does not exist that day) runs at the shifted instant rather than being skipped, and a job scheduled inside the fall-back overlap (a wall-clock time that occurs twice) runs once, at the first occurrence.

### `handler`

Type: `string` (required)

The module and export to invoke, as `<module path>#<named export>`, relative to the component directory - for example `./jobs.js#snapshotMetrics`. Omit the `#...` suffix to use the module's default export. Do not put a space before the `#` (YAML would treat the rest of the line as a comment and silently drop the export name). The module is loaded in your component's environment, so it has access to the same globals (`tables`, `databases`, `server`, and so on) as the rest of your component code.

A bad handler reference (missing module, missing export, non-function export) fails the component load at deploy time rather than failing silently at the first scheduled fire.

## Writing a Handler

The handler is called with a single context argument and may return a promise:

```javascript
// Nightly snapshot: roll the current state of a table into a dated snapshot record
export async function snapshotMetrics(context) {
	// context.jobName     - the configured job name
	// context.scheduledAt - the occurrence this run is for (Date)
	// context.catchUp     - true when this run is making up a missed occurrence
	const day = context.scheduledAt.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
	let total = 0;
	let active = 0;
	for await (const device of tables.Devices.search({})) {
		total++;
		if (device.status === 'active') active++;
	}
	// Keyed by day, so a duplicate delivery of the same occurrence just rewrites
	// the same record - this is what makes the handler idempotent
	await tables.DailyDeviceSnapshot.put({ id: day, total, active });
}

// Scheduled pull from an external API into a Harper table
export async function syncExchangeRates(context) {
	// Always bound external calls: a request that never settles would leave this
	// single-flight job stuck (runs never overlap, so nothing reschedules while
	// a run is in flight)
	const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/rates', { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000) });
	if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`rates API responded ${response.status}`);
	const payload = await response.json();
	// Persist only the fields you expect - Harper schemas are flexible by
	// default, so an unvalidated spread would store whatever shape the
	// upstream happened to send
	const { usd, eur, gbp } = payload;
	if (typeof usd !== 'number' || typeof eur !== 'number' || typeof gbp !== 'number') {
		throw new Error('rates API returned an unexpected shape');
	}
	await tables.ExchangeRates.put({ usd, eur, gbp, id: 'latest', fetchedAt: context.scheduledAt });
}
```

**Handlers should be idempotent.** Harper's clustering has no distributed lock, so leadership failover and daylight-saving fall-back can occasionally deliver the same logical occurrence twice. Design handlers so that running twice for one occurrence is harmless.

**A failed run is not retried.** If a handler throws (or its outbound request times out), the run is recorded with `lastStatus: error` and the occurrence is not made up - the job simply fires again at its next scheduled time. Handlers that need delivery guarantees should implement their own bounded retry/backoff inside the handler.

Runs of the same job never overlap. Missed time is not queued up, but it is also not always skipped outright: when a run outlasts its cadence, an interval job's next run starts promptly after the previous one finishes (a slow handler can therefore run back-to-back), and a cron job makes up at most its single most recent missed occurrence (delivered with `context.catchUp` set to `true`).

## Cluster Behavior

One node in the cluster - the scheduler leader - runs all scheduled jobs; the others watch. Leader election is automatic and requires no configuration:

- The leader maintains a heartbeat in the replicated `system` database. If it stops heartbeating (crash, shutdown, partition) for more than five minutes, the next node in line promotes itself; with default timings, failover completes within about six and a half minutes.
- A restarting node defers to an actively heartbeating leader, so leadership is stable across deploys and restarts.
- On a single-node instance, that node simply runs the jobs.

### Missed Occurrences

If the most recent occurrence of a cron job was missed - the leader was down, a failover was in progress, or daylight-saving time skipped the slot - the scheduler fires one catch-up run for it (with `context.catchUp` set to `true`). Only the single most recent missed occurrence is made up, not every occurrence missed during an outage. Interval jobs resume their cadence from their last recorded run.

A newly deployed job waits for its first scheduled time; it does not fire immediately on deploy.

### Replication Topology

The cluster-once guarantee holds only where the `hdb_scheduler_state` system table actually replicates: leader election and run-state coordination happen through its rows. On constrained or directional replication topologies where the `system` database does not reach every node, nodes that cannot see the leader's heartbeat will each elect themselves and run every job continuously - not just the occasional failover duplicate that idempotency covers. If you scope replication (for example with `replication.databases`), ensure the `system` database replicates among all scheduler-participating nodes.

### Run State

Each job's last run time, status, duration, and last error (if any) are recorded in the `hdb_scheduler_state` system table, alongside the leader lease. This state replicates across the cluster so a newly promoted leader knows what has already run.
