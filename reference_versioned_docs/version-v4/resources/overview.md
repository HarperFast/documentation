# Resources

Harper's Resource API is the foundation for building custom data access logic and connecting data sources. Resources are JavaScript classes that define how data is accessed, modified, subscribed to, and served over HTTP, MQTT, and WebSocket protocols.

## What Is a Resource?

A **Resource** is a class that provides a unified interface for a set of records or entities. Harper's built-in tables extend the base `Resource` class, and you can extend either `Resource` or a table class to implement custom behavior for any data source — internal or external.

Added in: v4.2.0

The Resource API is designed to mirror REST/HTTP semantics: methods map directly to HTTP verbs (`get`, `put`, `patch`, `post`, `delete`), making it straightforward to build API endpoints alongside custom data logic.

## Relationship to Other Features

- **Database tables** extend `Resource` automatically. You can use tables through the Resource API without writing any custom code.
- The **REST plugin** maps incoming HTTP requests to Resource methods. See [REST Overview](TODO:reference_versioned_docs/version-v4/rest/overview.md 'REST plugin reference').
- The **MQTT plugin** routes publish/subscribe messages to `publish` and `subscribe` Resource methods. See [MQTT Overview](TODO:reference_versioned_docs/version-v4/mqtt/overview.md 'MQTT plugin reference').
- **Global APIs** (`tables`, `databases`, `transaction`) provide access to resources from JavaScript code. See [Global APIs](./global-apis.md).
- The **`jsResource` plugin** (configured in `config.yaml`) registers a JavaScript file's exported Resource classes as endpoints.

## Resource API Versions

The Resource API has two behavioral modes controlled by the `loadAsInstance` static property:

- **V2 (recommended, `loadAsInstance = false`)**: Instance methods receive a `RequestTarget` as the first argument; no record is preloaded onto `this`. Recommended for all new code.
- **V1 (legacy, `loadAsInstance = true`)**: Instance methods are called with `this` pre-bound to the matching record. Preserved for backwards compatibility.

The [Resource API reference](./resource-api.md) is written against V2. For V1 behavior and migration guidance, see the legacy instance binding section of that page.

## Extending a Table

The most common use case is extending an existing table to add custom logic.

Starting with a table definition in a `schema.graphql`:

```graphql
# Omit the `@export` directive
type MyTable @table {
	id: ID @primaryKey
	# ...
}
```

> For more info on the schema API see [`Database / Schema`]()

Then, in a `resources.js` extend from the `tables.MyTable` global:

```javascript
export class MyTable extends tables.MyTable {
	static loadAsInstance = false; // use V2 API

	get(target) {
		// add a computed property before returning

		const record = await super.get(target)

		return { ...record, computedField: 'value' };
	}

	post(target, data) {
		// custom action on POST
		this.create({ ...data, status: 'pending' });
	}
}
```

Finally, ensure everything is configured appropriately:

```yaml
rest: true
graphqlSchema:
  files: schema.graphql
jsResource:
  files: resources.js
```

## Custom External Data Source

You can also extend the base `Resource` class directly to implement custom endpoints, or even wrap an external API or service as a custom caching layer:

```javascript
export class CustomEndpoint extends Resource {
	static loadAsInstance = false;

	get(target) {
		return {
			data: doSomething(),
		};
	}
}

export class MyExternalData extends Resource {
	static loadAsInstance = false;

	async get(target) {
		const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/${target.id}`);
		return response.json();
	}

	put(target, data) {
		return fetch(`https://api.example.com/${target.id}`, {
			method: 'PUT',
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		});
	}
}

// Use as a cache source for a local table
tables.MyCache.sourcedFrom(MyExternalData);
```

Resources are the true customization point for Harper. This is where the business logic of a Harper application really lives. There is a lot more to this API than these examples show. Ensure you fully review the [Resource API](./resource-api.md) documentation, and consider exploring the Learn guides for more information.

## Exporting Resources as Endpoints

Resources become HTTP/MQTT endpoints when they are exported. As the examples demonstrated if a Resource extends an existing table, make sure to not have conflicting exports between the schema and the JavaScript implementation. Alternatively, you can register resources programmatically using `server.resources.set()`. See [Global APIs — server.resources](./global-apis.md#serverresources-resources).
