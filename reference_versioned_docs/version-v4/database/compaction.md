# Compaction

Added in: v4.3.0

Database files grow over time as records are inserted, updated, and deleted. Deleted records and updated values leave behind free space (fragmentation) in the database file, which can increase file size and potentially affect performance. Compaction eliminates this free space, creating a smaller, contiguous database file.

> **Note:** Compaction does not compress your data. It removes internal fragmentation to make the file smaller. To enable compression on a database, use compaction to copy the database with updated storage configuration applied.

Compaction is also the mechanism to apply storage configuration changes (such as enabling compression) to existing databases, since some storage settings cannot be changed in-place.

## Copy Compaction

Creates a compacted copy of a database file. The original database is left unchanged.

> **Recommendation:** Stop Harper before performing copy compaction to prevent any record loss during the copy operation.

Run using the [CLI](TODO:reference_versioned_docs/version-v4/cli/commands.md):

```bash
harperdb copy-db <source-database> <target-database-path>
```

The `source-database` is the database name (not a file path). The target is the full file path where the compacted copy will be written.

To replace the original database with the compacted copy, move or rename the output file to the original database path after Harper is stopped.

**Example — compact the default `data` database:**

```bash
harperdb copy-db data /home/user/hdb/database/copy.mdb
```

## Compact on Start

Automatically compacts all non-system databases when Harper starts. Harper will not start until compaction is complete. Under the hood, it loops through all user databases, creates a backup of each, compacts it, replaces the original with the compacted copy, and removes the backup.

Configure in `harperdb-config.yaml`:

```yaml
storage:
  compactOnStart: true
  compactOnStartKeepBackup: false
```

Using CLI environment variables:

```bash
STORAGE_COMPACTONSTART=true STORAGE_COMPACTONSTARTKEEPBACKUP=true harperdb
```

### Options

| Option                     | Type    | Default | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compactOnStart`           | Boolean | `false` | Compact all databases at startup. Automatically reset to `false` after running. |
| `compactOnStartKeepBackup` | Boolean | `false` | Retain the backup copy created during compact on start                          |

> **Note:** `compactOnStart` is automatically set back to `false` after it runs, so compaction only happens on the next start if you explicitly re-enable it.
