Harper uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework to manage access to Harper instances. Each user is assigned a role that determines their permissions to access database resources and run operations.

## Roles

Role permissions in Harper are divided into two categories:

**Database Manipulation** — CRUD (create, read, update, delete) permissions against database data (tables and attributes).

**Database Definition** — Permissions to manage databases, tables, roles, users, and other system settings. These are restricted to the built-in `super_user` role.

### Built-In Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `super_user` | Full access to all operations and methods. The admin role. |
| `cluster_user` | Internal system role that allows clustered instances to communicate. Managed internally. |
| `structure_user` | Access to create and delete databases and tables. Can be set to `true` (all databases) or an array of database names (specific databases only). |

### User-Defined Roles

Admins (`super_user` users) can create custom roles with explicit permissions on specific tables and attributes.

- Unless a user-defined role has `super_user: true`, all permissions must be defined explicitly.
- Any table or database not included in the role's permission set will be inaccessible.
- `describe` operations return metadata only for databases, tables, and attributes that the role has CRUD permissions for.

## Permission Structure

When creating or altering a role, you define a `permission` object:

```json
{
	"operation": "add_role",
	"role": "software_developer",
	"permission": {
		"super_user": false,
		"database_name": {
			"tables": {
				"table_name1": {
					"read": true,
					"insert": true,
					"update": true,
					"delete": false,
					"attribute_permissions": [
						{
							"attribute_name": "attribute1",
							"read": true,
							"insert": true,
							"update": true
						}
					]
				},
				"table_name2": {
					"read": true,
					"insert": true,
					"update": true,
					"delete": false,
					"attribute_permissions": []
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Table Permissions

Each table entry defines CRUD access:

```jsonc
{
  "table_name": {
    "read": boolean,    // Access to read from this table
    "insert": boolean,  // Access to insert data
    "update": boolean,  // Access to update data
    "delete": boolean,  // Access to delete rows
    "attribute_permissions": [
      {
        "attribute_name": "attribute_name",
        "read": boolean,
        "insert": boolean,
        "update": boolean
        // Note: "delete" is not an attribute-level permission
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Important Rules

**Table-level:**
- If a database or table is not included in the permissions, the role has no access to it.
- If a table-level CRUD permission is `false`, setting the same CRUD permission to `true` on an attribute returns an error.

**Attribute-level:**
- If `attribute_permissions` is a non-empty array, only the listed attributes are accessible (plus the table's hash attribute — see below).
- If `attribute_permissions` is empty (`[]`), attribute access follows the table-level CRUD permissions.
- If any non-hash attribute is given CRUD access, the table's `hash_attribute` (primary key) automatically receives the same access, even if not explicitly listed.
- Any attribute not explicitly listed in a non-empty `attribute_permissions` array has no access.
- `DELETE` is not an attribute-level permission. Deleting rows is controlled at the table level.
- The `__createdtime__` and `__updatedtime__` attributes managed by Harper can have `read` permissions set; other attribute-level permissions for these fields are ignored.

## Troubleshooting: "Must execute as User"

If you see the error `Error: Must execute as <<username>>`, it means Harper was installed as a specific OS user and must be run by that same user. Harper stores files natively on the operating system and only allows the Harper executable to be run by a single user — this prevents file permission issues and keeps the installation secure.

To resolve: run Harper with the same OS user account used during installation.
