title: Harper Cloud
---

Harper Cloud (also sometimes referred to as Harper Studio) was Harper's original PaaS offering.
It has been fully replaced by [Harper Fabric](https://fabric.harper.fast).
All users are encouraged to migrate or get started using Harper Fabric immediately.

[Local Studio](../studio/overview.md) is still an available feature, and now uses the same client as Harper Fabric.

Reach out to [support@harperdb.io](mailto:support@harperdb.io) or join our community [Discord](https://harper.fast/discord) if you have questions.
