title: Using AI Agents
---

AI-powered development tools can significantly accelerate your workflow when building Harper applications. Whether you want a dedicated assistant or prefer using your favorite LLM, Harper provides the tools and context needed to make AI an effective part of your development process.

## Harper Agent

The `harper-agent` is a purpose-built AI assistant designed specifically for Harper development. It understands the Harper ecosystem and can help you with tasks ranging from project setup to debugging.

### Features

- **Application Creation**: Scaffold full Harper applications from natural language descriptions.
- **Code Generation**: Write schema definitions, custom functions, and integration code.
- **Diagnosis and Running**: Run your application and let the agent diagnose and fix errors.
- **Browser Control**: The agent can even interact with a browser to help you test and manage your applications.

### Installation

Install the Harper Agent globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @harperfast/agent
```

### Usage

To start the agent, simply run:

```bash
harper-agent
```

On first run, it will help you configure your preferred AI model (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, or Ollama). Once configured, you can interact with it directly from your terminal.

## Skills: Empowering General-Purpose Agents

If you prefer using general-purpose AI tools like **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Cursor**, you can provide them with Harper-specific "Skills" to improve their accuracy and performance.

### What are Skills?

Skills are a collection of Harper-specific context, documentation, and best practices. When an AI agent has access to these skills, it is much more likely to generate high-quality, idiomatic Harper code and follow current best practices.

### Getting Skills

The easiest way to get Harper skills is by using the `create-harper` bootstrapper. When you create a new Harper project, a `skills/` directory is automatically included.

```bash
npm create harper@latest
```

You can also browse our ever evolving library of skills here:

### How to use Skills

Once you have a `skills/` directory in your project, you can use it with your favorite AI tools:

- **Chat-based AI (Claude/ChatGPT)**: Upload the markdown files from the `skills/` directory to your conversation to provide the AI with immediate context.
- **IDE Extensions (Cursor/Copilot)**: Ensure these tools are indexing your project. They will automatically pick up the context from the `skills/` directory to provide better completions and chat responses.
- **Custom Agents**: If you are building your own AI-powered workflows, you can point your agent to these skills to give it specialized knowledge of Harper.

By leveraging these AI tools, you can move from idea to a running Harper application faster than ever before.
