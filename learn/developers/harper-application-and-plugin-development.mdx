{/* AI Generated Outline: Introduction paragraph - to be written in prose style explaining that this guide deepens the understanding of Harper Applications beyond the Getting Started section, focusing on the architecture, development patterns, and tooling that developers use day-to-day when building with Harper. */}

In the Getting Started guides you successfully installed Harper and created your first application. You experienced Harper's schema and database system, and the automatic REST API feature too. This guide dives deeper into Harper's Component Architecture differentiating applications from plugins, and introduces multiple new ways to interact with Harper. By the end of this guide you will be a confident Harper application developer capable of creating just about anything with Harper!

## What You Will Learn

- The fundamental concepts and architecture of Harper Applications
- How applications, plugins, and extensions work together in the Harper ecosystem
- The distinction between applications and extensions/plugins, and when to use each
- How to interact with Harper using the Operations API and CLI
- Essential debugging techniques for Harper application development
- Best practices for structuring and developing Harper applications

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Install and Connect Harper](../getting-started/install-and-connect-harper)
- Completed [Create Your First Application](../getting-started/create-your-first-application)
- Basic familiarity with Node.js and JavaScript
- Working Harper installation (local or Fabric)

## Revisiting Harper's Architecture

{/* AI Generated Outline: Expand on the architecture introduced in Getting Started, providing deeper explanation of the component system. Use the architecture diagram/ASCII art from Getting Started as reference point but explain in more detail how the layers interact. */}

In the previous guide we introduced a high-level Harper architecture diagram:

<HarperArchitectureDiagram/>

And defined some key Harper concepts:

**Components** are extensions of the core Harper systems, and are further classified as **plugins** and **applications**.

**Plugins** have access to APIs exposing many of Harper's core services, and are capable of implementing more advanced features than what the core services provide.

**Applications** use plugins to implement user-facing functionality and business logic, such as implementing database schemas and creating web applications.

The most important thing to remember is that plugins enable the functionality and applications implement it. Similar to that of a front-end framework. React is like a plugin; on its own it doesn't actually do anything. You actually need to build an application with React for it do anything meaningful.

Plugins have replaced an old Harper component system called **extensions**. Plugins and extensions have essentially the same definition, but different APIs. In time, extensions will be deprecated, and we encourage all developers to use the plugins immediately. However, both systems are fully supported in Harper v4 and v5.

### The Harper Stack in Detail

{/* AI Generated Outline: Detailed prose explanation of each layer:
- Core Services (database, networking, component management) - what they provide, why they matter
- Plugins (built-in vs custom) - their role in extending core functionality
- Applications - the user-facing implementations that tie everything together */}

Harper itself is a Node.js application. It runs in a single process, and uses worker threads for parallelization. Harper is meant to be a long-running process. Harper instances are meant to be treated as "serverful" systems (contrary to ephemeral "serverless" services). As such, Harper's main thread is meant to always stay running. The concept of a "restart" is specific to restarting the worker threads, and persisting the main thread. Harper uses a rolling restart in order to ensure the Harper system remains functional throughout a restart. Furthermore, the entire Harper process can be safely stopped and started, but generally that should be unnecessary for application development.

:::note
Harper provides an environment variable, `HARPER_EXIT_ON_RESTART`, that will exit the process when it is instructed to restart. This is meant to be used along side a container environment restart policy such as docker's `--restart=unless-stopped` so that the entire Harper process can be restarted. Its important to keep in mind that full process restarts will disrupt functionality.
:::

Plugins run exclusively on worker threads, but the older version, extensions, can run on both the main and worker threads. Some of Harper's core services, such as the database and the networking socket router, are implemented directly within the main process. However, a majority of Harper's core functionality is implemented as built-in plugins and extensions. One critical advantage that plugins have over extensions is their ability to respond to configuration changes without restarting.

Both the `graphqlSchema` database schema system and the `rest` automatic REST API features from the previous guide are technically implemented as built-in extensions still. If you were running Harper locally, the `harper dev` command automatically restarted Harper for you. And if you were using Fabric, this is why you had to click on the "Restart Cluster" button. We are actively migrating all built-in extensions to the plugin API, and once complete, a lot of Harper will run entirely in worker threads and require less restarts in order to respond to configuration and file changes. Aside from the subtle differences in execution context, extensions and plugins very much serve the same purpose. Aside from this section where we are deliberately specifying the technical differences between the two, we have switched to using the plugin terminology entirely. This is to simplify and align our documentation to Harpers ideal future.

Since core services and plugins are the building blocks of applications, they too can run across all threads. As an application developer, you don't necessarily need to worry to much about what plugins are doing behind the scenes; however, its important to keep in mind that for now, restarting Harper is an important step throughout application development, deployment, and management. Later in this guide you will learn other methods for restarting Harper beyond just the `dev` command.

### Component Classification: Built-in vs Custom

{/* AI Generated Outline: Explain the distinction between built-in and custom components, why this matters for development, and how to reference each type. Include practical examples. */}

Harper further classifies components (plugins and applications) as either built-in or custom. **Built-in** components are internal to Harper, require no additional installation steps, and are immediately accessible for use. The `graphqlSchema` and `rest` plugins are great examples of built-in plugins. **Custom** components are external to Harper, generally available as an npm package or git repository, and do require additional installation steps in order to be used. Custom components can be authored by anyone, including Harper. Any of Harper's official custom components are published using the `@harperdb` and `@harper` package scopes, such as the [`@harperdb/nextjs`](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) plugin for developing Next.js applications or the [`@harperdb/status-check`](https://github.com/HarperDB/status-check) application.

Harper's reference documentation contains detailed documentation for all built-in components. Custom components will be documented within their respective repositories.

Harper does not currently include any built-in applications, making "custom applications" a bit redundant. Generally, we just refer to them as "applications". However, there is a multitude of both built-in and custom plugins, and so the documentation tends to specify whenever relevant.

{/* The AI outline included a sub-section here for component lifecycle. I think we have enough text so far and need to move into some actual development. I think lifecycle will fit in better later too when the user has learned more about managing components, particularly applications using the Operations API and CLI. */}

{/* I'm not sold on these next four sub-sections. I think they are good titles for the reference page on components. I think the content written above walks the line of informative but not-overly technical well-enough. For more in depth docs, that is where the components/applications/plugins reference page will come into play. Leaving the sections here for now as the rest of the guide is drafted, but will likely move them and rewrite the reference page quite a bit. */}

{/* ### What Makes Something an Application? */}

{/* AI Generated Outline: Elaborate on applications as user-facing implementations. Provide concrete examples:
- A Next.js web application serving a UI
- An Apollo GraphQL server providing an API
- A custom REST API using resources.js
Use the mermaid diagram from docs/developers/applications/index.md as visual aid. */}

{/* ### What Makes Something a Plugin? */}

{/* AI Generated Outline: Explain extensions as the building blocks that enable functionality. Examples:
- `graphqlSchema` enables table definition (already used in Getting Started)
- `rest` enables automatic REST API generation (already used in Getting Started)
- `@harperdb/nextjs` enables building Next.js apps
- Custom extensions can depend on other extensions */}

{/* ### When to Build an Application vs an Plugin */}

{/* AI Generated Outline: Practical guidance on decision-making. Key principle: extensions enable, applications implement. Provide decision tree or clear guidelines. */}

{/* ### The Plugin API */}

{/* AI Generated Outline: Briefly mention the v4.6+ plugin system as covered in docs/developers/applications/index.md, note it's experimental, and reference the plugin API docs for readers who want to explore. Don't go too deep since this is fundamentals. */}

## Working with the Operations API

{/* AI Generated Outline: Introduce the Operations API as the primary interface for managing Harper programmatically. Build on the /health endpoint from Getting Started. */}

In the first guide, we introduced you to the `/health` endpoint. This is provided by Harper's built-in Operations API.

The **Operations API** provides a full set of capabilities for configuring, deploying, administering, and controlling Harper. It is configured on port `9925` by default, and primarily functions through JSON-based, POST requests to the root path `/`. It has some additional functionalities too such as the `/health` endpoint and an OpenAPI endpoint `/api/openapi/rest`.

The operations API root path POST requests must be authenticated. Harper provides an `authentication.authorizeLocal` configuration option for automatically authorizing any requests from the loopback IP address as the superuser (the one created during Harper installation). This option is enabled automatically when Harper is installed using the `dev` default config (as was instructed in the getting started guide). Thus, local installation users may make unauthenticated requests. Container based installation users must use `--network host` when running the container in order to make use of this option. And Fabric or any other remote host installations generally must authenticate all requests.

:::note
The `authentication.authorizeLocal` option should be disabled for any Harper servers that may be accessed by untrusted users from the same instance. For example, it should be disabled if you are using a local proxy, or for general server hardening.
:::

This and future learn guides will omit `Authorization` headers from any request examples. The assumption is that all local installation readers have `authorizeLocal` enabled, local container installation users are running the container with a shared network host, and Fabric users are using the UI or an authenticated HTTP client to make requests. Nonetheless, we've included the following section on how to setup Basic Authentication in case it is necessary. Most readers may skip ahead to the [First Operation API Request](#first-operation-api-request) section.

<details>
	<summary>Basic Authentication</summary>

The simplest authorization scheme is [Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) which transmits credentials as username/password pairs encoded using base64. Importantly, this scheme does not encrypt credentials. If used over an insecure connection, such as HTTP, they are susceptible to being compromised. Only ever use Basic Authentication over secured connections, such as HTTPS. Even then, its better to upgrade to an encryption based authentication scheme or certificates. Harper supports many different authentication mechanisms, and they will all be covered in later Learn guides.

Use the username and password values from the previous [Install and Connect](/learn/getting-started/install-and-connect-harper) guide to generate an authorization value. The important part is to combine the `username` and `password` using a colon `:` character, encode that using base64, and then append the result to `"Basic "`. Here are some efficient methodologies:

{/* Maybe consider using Tabs here with labels like "Node.js <=v24" and ("Web" or "Winter" or "W/MCA" if defined that abbreviation earlier somehow?) */}

In Node.js v24 or earlier use the [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html) API:

```typescript
// Ensure you replace these with your installation's values 
const username = 'HDB_ADMIN';
const password = 'abc123!';
const credentials = Buffer.from(`${username}:${password}`).toString('base64');
const authorizationValue = `Basic ${credentials}`;
```

For Node.js v25 or later, most web browser consoles, and any WinterTC Minimum Common API compatible runtime use the [`Uint8Array.prototype.toBase64()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/toBase64) API:

```typescript
// Ensure you replace these with your installation's values 
const username = 'HDB_ADMIN';
const password = 'abc123!';
const credentials = new TextEncoder().encode(`${username}:${password}`).toBase64();
const authorizationValue = `Basic ${credentials}`;
```

> Both of these options are preferred over [`btoa()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/btoa) do to its limitation to Latin-1 character set.

And finally, you would use the `authorizationValue` as the value for the `Authorization` header such as:

```typescript
fetch('/', {
	// ...
	headers: {
		'Authorization': authorizationValue,
	},
	// ...
});
```

</details>

### First Operations API Request

There are many great operations to chose from, but to get started, lets try the `get_status` operation.

:::note
All `operation` values will be in snake_case; all lowercase and underscores `_` in-place of spaces.
:::

First, ensure Harper is running (refer to the previous guide if you need a quick refresher). Then, using your HTTP client of choice, create a POST request to your running Harper instance with `Content-Type: application/json` header, and a JSON body containing `{ "operation": "get_status" }`.

> Fabric users, remember to replace `http://localhost` with your Fabric instance URL, and include an authorization header.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9925/' \
	-X POST \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{ "operation": "get_status" }'
```

You may also include `| jq` here to render the output as JSON.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fetch">

```typescript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9925/', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		"operation": "get_status"
	}),
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This operation returns a JSON object with three top-level properties: `restartRequired`, `systemStatus`, and `componentStatus`.

The `restartRequired` property is a mechanism for Harper plugins to indicate they require a restart for some changes to take effect (more on this later).

The other two properties are lists containing status objects corresponding to different parts of Harper. These should all read `"status": "healthy"` right now, and you may recognize some of the `"name"` and `"componentName"` fields as they correspond to Harper's built-in subsystems (such as `"http"`, `"threads"`, and `"authentication"`).

### More with Operations API

The Operations API is mainly intended to be used for system management purposes. It does have the ability to do data management (create/modify/query databases, tables, and records), Harper has released significantly more ergonomic and performant methods instead.

Harper keeps a reference of all operations in the Operations API reference documentation, but here a few more you can try immediately: `user_info`, `read_log`, and `describe_all`.

For `describe_all` to work, ensure that you are still running the Harper application you created in the previous guide. If you need to, checkout the [`02-rest-api`](https://github.com/HarperFast/create-your-first-application/tree/02-rest-api) branch of the `HarperFast/create-your-first-application` repository to ensure you have the necessary application files for this example.

You should see a JSON object with a top-level property `"data"`. This operation returns a map of all databases and tables. The `"data"` is the default database in Harper. Within that object, there should be a `"Dog"` key. This is the table you defined with `graphqlSchema` in the previous guide.

The entire JSON response should look something like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Dog": {
      "schema": "data",
      "name": "Dog",
      "hash_attribute": "id",
      "audit": true,
      "schema_defined": true,
      "attributes": [
        {
          "attribute": "id",
          "type": "ID",
          "is_primary_key": true
        },
        {
          "attribute": "name",
          "type": "String"
        },
        {
          "attribute": "breed",
          "type": "String"
        },
        {
          "attribute": "age",
          "type": "Int"
        }
      ],
      "db_size": 212992,
      "sources": [],
      "record_count": 1,
      "table_size": 16384,
      "db_audit_size": 16384
    }
  }
}
```

Now lets keep drilling down in specificity by using the `describe_database` and then the `describe_table` operations. The difference this time is that these operations require additional properties.

For `describe_database`, you can specify `"database": "data"`. The entire request body would look something like this:

```json
{
	"operation": "describe_database",
	"database": "data"
}
```

The response this time should omit the top-level `"data"` key, and instead be just an object containing `"Dog"` (the singular table defined in the `data` database so far).

And for `describe_table`, you would specify both `"database": "data"` and `"table": "Dog"`,

```json
{
	"operation": "describe_database",
	"database": "data",
	"table": "Dog"
}
```

Now there is yet another way to get information about the `Dog` table; with the REST interface!

Create a `GET` request to `http://localhost:9926/Dog` and its important that you omit any trailing forward slash `/`, this request should return a slightly different JSON object describing the `Dog` table.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9926/Dog' | jq
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fetch">

```typescript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9926/Dog');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Expected result:

```json
{
  "records": "./",
  "name": "Dog",
  "database": "data",
  "auditSize": 3,
  "attributes": [
    {
      "type": "ID",
      "name": "id",
      "isPrimaryKey": true,
      "attribute": "id"
    },
    {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "name",
      "attribute": "name"
    },
    {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "breed",
      "attribute": "breed"
    },
    {
      "type": "Int",
      "name": "age",
      "attribute": "age"
    }
  ]
}
```

All in all, the Operations API is fundamental tool for managing and introspecting your Harper instance. We'll cover more operations throughout the Learn guides.

{/* 
(This comment was from before when this example used get_configuration)
I had an idea for a section here that dives into the configuration object. This would be an opportunity to like highlight different default features as well as
default configuration values. It would also highlight like relevant things the user may want to tweak, such as logging level, threads debugging, etc. But I've 
decided that that content is better suited for specific sections. Like later in this guide it will introduce using the debugger, and will refer to modifying the
`threads.debug` setting in order to do so. I think if anything, "exploring the configuration object" should just be a properly detailed reference page on the 
Harper configuration.

### Exploring the Harper Configuration Object

```json
{ ... }
```

*/}

{/* 

I had this section here because I originally wanted to guide local users through enforcing authorization, but per other conversations we switched to the other way. this is no longer necessary; users will get experience setting config options later. 

### Modifying the Harper Configuration using the Operations API

Particularly relevant for local installation users, lets learn how to disable the `authentication.authorizeLocal` property so that you have the same experience as Fabric users do providing `Authorization` headers for all Operations API requests. Keep in mind, Learn guides will always specify an `Authorization` header for requests, but it is possible for local installation users to ignore it if they leave this option enabled.

:::important
You should never enable this option on Fabric or other hosted instances. It is generally secure even if enabled, but there are possible hosting configurations that can result in insecure access to your Harper instance.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9925/' \
	-X POST \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: <authorizationValue>" \
	-d '{ "operation": "set_configuration", "authentication_authorizelocal": false }'
```

You may also include `| jq` here to render the output as JSON.

	body: JSON.stringify({
		"operation": "set_configuration",
		"authentication_authorizelocal": false
	}),
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

  </TabItem>

{/* I'm not sure we really need this section; a callout to the reference docs for _all_ Operations would be better IMO */}

## Expanding your Harper Application with custom Resources

If you're following along from getting started, you should have a basic Harper application running containing a `schema.graphql` and `config.yaml` files defining a simple `Dog` table and REST endpoint. Lets expand on this example while also exploring more of Harper's lifecycle and application development capabilities.

:::note
If you want to ensure you're application code is at the right starting point, checkout the [`02-rest-api`](https://github.com/HarperFast/create-your-first-application/tree/02-rest-api) branch of the `HarperFast/create-your-first-application` repository.
:::

Create a new file `resources.js` within your Harper application; here we are going to define custom Resources.

**Resources** are the mechanism for defining custom functionality in your Harper application. This gives you tremendous flexibility and control over how data is accessed and modified in Harper. The corresponding Resource API is a unified API for modeling different data sources within Harper as JavaScript classes. Generally, this is where the core business logic of your application lives. Database tables (the ones defined by `graphqlSchema` entries) are `Resource` classes, and so extending the function of a table is as simple as extending their class.

Resource classes have methods that correspond to standard HTTP/REST methods, like `get`, `post`, `patch`, and `put` to implement specific handling for any of these methods (for tables they all have default implementations). Furthermore, by simply `export` 'ing a resource class, Harper will generate REST API endpoints for it just like the `@export` directive did in `graphqlSchema`. The Resource API is quite powerful, and we'll dive into different aspects throughout future Learn guides, but for now lets start with a trivial example extending the existing `Dog` table that already exists in your application.

Inside of `resources.js` add the following code for defining a `DogWithHumanAge` custom resource:

```javascript
// Fun fact, the 7:1 ratio is a misconception
// https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/
function calculateHumanAge(dogAge) {
	if (dogAge === 1) {
		return 15;
	} else if (dogAge === 2) {
		return 24;
	} else {
		return 24 + 5 * dogAge - 2;
	}
}

export class DogWithHumanAge extends tables.Dog {
	static loadAsInstance = false;
	async get(target) {
		const dogRecord = await super.get(target);

		return {
			...dogRecord,
			humanAge: calculateHumanAge(dogRecord.age),
		}
	}
}
```

Then open `config.yaml` and add the `jsResource` plugin:

```yaml
# Harper application configuration
graphqlSchema:
  files: 'schema.graphql'
jsResource:
  files: 'resources.js'
rest: true
```

Ensure Harper has restarted (automatically in `dev` mode or by manually starting/stopping it), and then prepare to query the new resource. In the getting started guide we created a singular dog record with an id of `001`. Create a `GET` request to `/DogWithHumanAge/001` and display the resulting JSON:

<Tabs groupId="http-client">
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:9926/DogWithHumanAge/001' | jq
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fetch">

```typescript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9926/DogWithHumanAge/001');
const dog = await response.json();
console.log(dog);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The resulting JSON object should look similar to the original `Dog/001` entry, except this time there is a new property `humanAge`.

Notably, did you see how we were able to use the `001` id with the new resource immediately? And it was able to derive the underlying `Dog` record? Lets take a closer look at the custom resource implementation:

```javascript
export class DogWithHumanAge extends tables.Dog {
	// ...
}
```

The `DogWithHumanAge` class extends from `tables.Dog`. The `tables` reference is a global added by Harper that is a map of all tables within the instance, such as the ones defined by `graphqlSchema`. The `export` keyword is used here to instruct Harper to automatically generated a REST API endpoint for the custom resource.

```javascript
export class DogWithHumanAge extends tables.Dog {
	static loadAsInstance = false;
	async get (target) {
		// ...
	}
}
```

The `static loadAsInstance = false;` line established that the Resource instances will not be bound to a specific record. Instead instances represent the whole table, capturing the context and current transactional state.

```javascript
export class DogWithHumanAge extends tables.Dog {
	static loadAsInstance = false;
	async get(target) {
		const dogRecord = await super.get(target);

		return {
			...dogRecord,
			humanAge: calculateHumanAge(dogRecord.age),
		}
	}
}
```

Thus, the `super` part of `const dogRecord = await super.get(target);` refers to the original `tables.Dog`. By passing through the `target` object to `super.get(target)`, we are querying the original `Dog` table defined by `graphqlSchema`. The `dogRecord` instance returned here corresponds to whatever the request `/<id>` portion specified.

The rest of the `get()` method returns a new object with a copy of `dogRecord` and a newly computed `humanAge` field.

The `dogRecord` isn't just a plain JSON object; it has its own set of methods including comprehensive getters and setters. However, Harper does make all the defined properties available as enumerable properties so by using the `...` spread operator, you can easily copy all of the relevant properties of the `dogRecord` instance.

Now if you perhaps tried to use a query string selector, like `GET /DogWithHumanAge/?age=5`, this `get()` method implementation can't quite handle it yet; but this will be covered soon!

For now, celebrate that you've successfully implemented your first custom resource!
