Harper is an all-in-one backend technology that fuses database technologies, caching, application hosting, and messaging functions into a single system. Unlike traditional architectures where each piece runs independently and incurs extra costs and latency from serialization and network operations between processes, Harper systems can handle workloads seamlessly and efficiently.

Here, you'll find all things Harper, and everything you need to get started, troubleshoot issues, and make the most of our platform.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started using Harper is to head over to the [Learn](/learn/) section and work through the Getting Started and Developer guides.
